## Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital age, technology has become an integral part of daily life, impacting various aspects of individual well-being. This dataset examines the intersection between technology usage and mental health by exploring behavioral patterns and their connections with mental health indicators. The primary objective of this dataset is to help understand how factors like social media engagement, screen time, and gaming relate to mental health outcomes, stress levels, and sleep quality. As mental health awareness becomes increasingly important, this dataset aims to provide insights into the influence of digital habits on wellness.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze the Relationship Between Technology and Mental Health:** Examine correlations between daily technology use (e.g., hours spent on social media, gaming, and screen time) and mental health indicators like mental health status, stress, and sleep quality.
2. **Identify Behavioral Patterns Influencing Wellness:** Study patterns such as physical activity, access to support systems, and the impact of work environments on mental health.
3. **Build Predictive Models for Mental Health Trends:** Develop predictive models that offer insights into mental health trends based on technology usage.

## Dataset Description
This dataset contains **10,000 rows** and **14 columns** that capture a range of variables related to technology use and mental health outcomes. Below is a detailed description of each variable:
