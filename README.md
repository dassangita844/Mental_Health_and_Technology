# **The Impact of Digital Technology on Mental Well-being**

## **Introduction**

This project explores the intersection of digital technology usage and its impact on mental health. In an era where technology has become an integral part of everyday life, understanding its relationship with mental health is crucial. This dataset provides insights into how various digital habits, such as social media engagement, screen time, and gaming, are linked to mental health outcomes such as stress levels, sleep quality, and overall mental well-being.

The goal of this study is to analyze patterns in technology usage and identify behavioral factors that may influence mental health. By examining these associations, we aim to build predictive models to better understand mental health trends and raise awareness of the effects of technology on wellness.

## **Objectives**

- **Analyze the Relationship Between Technology and Mental Health:**  
  We aim to explore correlations between daily technology use (e.g., social media, screen time, gaming) and key mental health indicators such as stress levels, mental health status, and sleep quality.
  
- **Identify Behavioral Patterns Influencing Wellness:**  
  This study will investigate how factors such as physical activity, access to support systems, and work environment influence mental health.

- **Build Predictive Models for Mental Health Trends:**  
  Using the dataset, we aim to create models that predict mental health trends based on the usage of digital technology, helping to better understand its impact.

## **Variables**

### **Numerical Variables:**

| **Variable Name**           | **Description**                                            |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Age                         | Age of the participant.                                   |
| Technology_Usage_Hours      | Average daily hours spent on technology.                   |
| Social_Media_Usage_Hours    | Average daily hours spent on social media.                 |
| Gaming_Hours                | Average daily hours spent on online gaming.                |
| Screen_Time_Hours           | Total daily screen time in hours.                          |
| Sleep_Hours                 | Average daily sleep duration in hours.                     |
| Physical_Activity_Hours     | Average daily physical activity in hours.                  |

### **Categorical Variables:**

| **Variable Name**           | **Description**                                            |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| User_ID                     | Unique identifier for each participant.                    |
| Gender                      | Gender of the participant (male, female, or other).        |
| Mental_Health_Status        | Self-reported mental health status (poor, fair, good, excellent). |
| Stress_Level                | Self-reported stress level (low, medium, high).            |
| Support_Systems_Access      | Whether the participant has access to support systems (yes/no). |
| Work_Environment_Impact     | Impact of work environment on mental health (positive, neutral, negative). |
| Online_Support_Usage       | Whether the participant uses online support (yes/no).      |

### **Analysis Steps:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
- Apply statistical methods to assess correlations between variables.
- Build predictive models (e.g., random forest, XGBoost, multinomial logistic regression and support vector machine) to predict mental health outcomes based on technology usage.

## **Results & Insights**

- The dataset allows for an in-depth analysis of how digital technology usage impacts mental health.  
- By studying behavioral patterns such as screen time, social media usage, and gaming, we aim to identify areas where digital habits may be contributing to stress, poor sleep, or mental health issues.
- Predictive models based on this data could provide valuable insights for developing mental health interventions or guidelines for healthier technology usage.
